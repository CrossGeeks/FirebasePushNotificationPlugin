# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# Defines that a commit to the master branch should trigger this build
trigger:
- master

# Defines that PRs against this branch should also trigger this build
pr:
- master

# The type of machine this build should run on and what software should be on it
pool:
  vmImage: macos-10.14

# The different steps in our build
steps:

- bash: sudo $AGENT_HOMEDIRECTORY/scripts/select-xamarin-sdk.sh $(MONO_VERSION)
  displayName: Switch to the latest Xamarin SDK

- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Use .Net Core sdk'
  inputs:
     version: $(NETCORE_VERSION)
     includePreviewVersions: false

- task: MSBuild@1
  displayName: 'Build solution'
  inputs:

    msbuildArguments: '/restore /t:Build /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true /p:Deterministic=false /p:PackageOutputPath=$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)'
